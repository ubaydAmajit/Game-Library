# Game Library Web Application

A comprehensive Flask-based web application for managing and exploring a game library. This application allows users to browse, search, review, and manage their personal game collections with features like wishlists, user profiles, and game reviews.

## 🎮 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Game Library**: Browse and explore a comprehensive collection of games from Steam
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system
- **Game Search**: Search games by title, genre, publisher, or other criteria
- **Game Details**: View detailed information about games including descriptions, genres, publishers, and release dates
- **User Reviews**: Read and write reviews for games with rating system
- **Personal Wishlist**: Add games to your personal wishlist for future reference
- **User Profiles**: Manage user accounts and view gaming preferences

### Technical Features
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly web interface
- **Database Support**: SQLAlchemy ORM with support for multiple database backends
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean architecture with repository pattern for data access
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with pytest
- **Form Validation**: Secure form handling with WTForms and CSRF protection

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Model**: Core business entities (Game, User, Review, Wishlist, Publisher, Genre)
- **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction supporting both memory and database storage
- **Web Layer**: Flask blueprints for different functional areas
- **Adapters**: Data readers and ORM mappings for external data sources
